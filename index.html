<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>One of the most unique adventure sci-fi movies of all time with an absolute masterpiece of a climax</p>

<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>A clever piece of storytelling which results in an informative and thrilling depiction of the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer</p>

<h3>Logan</h3>
<p>The best comic book movie of all time in my opinion (The Dark Night is a close second). Amazing story with a grounded and mature depiction of Wolverine who is past is prime</p>
